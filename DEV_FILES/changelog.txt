    * New minimal player mode
    * Removed drag and drop support (reorder is still possible using arrows)
    * Now using audio metadata to store lyrics by default (misc and same folder are still supported)
    * Seeking with mouse is a bit choppy (bug in GTK4 issue 4939 - had to use workaround)

    * Probably new bugs (not intentional though)

*A special release, named after a truly special person.*

0.4.0 - Jul. 22. 2022.
Complete migration to GTK4/LibAdwaita
* Switching back to GStreamer...
* Lots of improvements regarding flatpak packaging
* Fixed issue related to playing mp4 videos
* Complete migration to LibAdwaita and GTK4 (nearly full rewrite)
* Lots of bugfixes
* Several GUI related performance fixes
* Updated custom widgets (TrackBox now based on ActionRow)
* Code-based GUI generation instead of Glade
* Brand new preferences (frontend and backend)
* Fresh look and feel (including refreshed icon)
* More attention to GNOME design standards
* Album cover now part of the TrackBox widget
* New minimal player mode
* Removed drag and drop support (reorder is still possible using arrows)
* Now using audio metadata to store lyrics by default (misc and same folder are still supported)
* Seeking with mouse is a bit choppy (bug in GTK4 issue 4939 - had to use workaround)
* Video playback is quite power-hungry, but stable (more efficient solution is WIP, see gst-plugins-rs MR 588)
* Probably new bugs (not intentional though)
